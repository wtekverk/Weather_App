# Weather_App


## Description

This application is a weather app. When you type in a city this application will both store that city in your history list for easy recall and show you the weather for both today and the rest of the week. The current weather includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index and a icon to represent the weather. The forecasted weather includes humidity, temperature and a weather icon. 

This project was tricky for me because there were a lot of components that had to be synced to the site. This was really the first time I used so many components from an API so that was the biggest challenge for me. 


## Installation 

This application is launched and ready to go at (https://wtekverk.github.io/Weather_App/)


## Usage 

The usage for this app is incredibly simple. Type in any city and press the search button and you will be prompted with the information. If you want to return to that city's information at any time you can simply find it in the history section
